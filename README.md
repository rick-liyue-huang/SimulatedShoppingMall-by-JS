# The Simulated ShoppingMall Project

In this new project, I will use H5, CSS and original JS(jQuery) to create the whole frontend, and the purpose of it is to strengthen the modularization(module) thoughts and review how to separate the frontend and backend in a real-time project.

### What's the project look like
This is one real-time shopping-mall website project, including products lists, product detail, customer register, customer login, customer purchase, checkout, and so on. All the interactive data between frontend and backend are real.

One online-shop should have the following functions, products purchase, products show, purchase cart, products order, order center, and payment. And also have some customer information.
